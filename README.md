Mocha Bootstrap
===============

Description
-----------
Mocha Bootstrap demonstrates how to create server side Mocha tests with Require.js and Node.js.
There was precious little documentation on how to get this done, so I figured out how
to do it through sheer will and determination.

`git clone git://github.com/clubajax/mocha-bootstrap.git mocha-bootstrap`

Install dependencies
```
$ cd mocha-bootstrap
$ npm install
